# Set up an API Using the API Gateway Console<a name="create-api-using-console"></a>

 To set up an API Gateway API using the API Gateway console, see [TUTORIAL: Build an API with HTTP Non\-Proxy Integration](api-gateway-create-api-step-by-step.md)\. 

 You can learn how to set up an API by following an example\. For more information, see [TUTORIAL: Create a REST API by Importing an Example](api-gateway-create-api-from-example.md)\. 

 Alternatively, you can set up an API by using the API Gateway [Import API](api-gateway-import-api.md) feature to upload an external API definition, such as one expressed in [OpenAPI 2\.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) with the [API Gateway Extensions to OpenAPI](api-gateway-swagger-extensions.md)\. The example provided in [TUTORIAL: Create a REST API by Importing an Example](api-gateway-create-api-from-example.md) uses the Import API feature\.
