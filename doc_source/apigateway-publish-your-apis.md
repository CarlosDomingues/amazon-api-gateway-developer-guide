# Publishing Your API Gateway APIs<a name="apigateway-publish-your-apis"></a>

Once you've deployed your APIs, you can publish them by deploying a developer portal, and you can sell your APIs as a SaaS through the AWS Marketplace\. You can also create a custom domain name for your API\. You can export your API definitions to generate an SDK for your users to call the API using a supported programming language\. And you can use a [canary release](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html) for testing new changes\.
