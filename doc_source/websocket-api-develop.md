# Developing a WebSocket API in API Gateway<a name="websocket-api-develop"></a>

This section provides details about API Gateway capabilities that you need while you're developing your API Gateway APIs\.

As you're developing your API Gateway API, you decide on a number of characteristics of your API\. These characteristics depend on the use case of your API\. For example, you might want to only allow certain clients to call your API, or you might want it to be available to everyone\. You might want an API call to execute a Lambda function, make a database query, or call an application\.
