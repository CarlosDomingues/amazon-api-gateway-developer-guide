# Working with Routes for HTTP APIs<a name="http-api-develop-routes"></a>

Routes direct incoming API requests to backend resources\. Routes consist of two parts: an HTTP method and a resource path—for example, `GET /pets`\. You can define specific HTTP methods for your route, or use the ANY method to match all methods that you haven't defined for a resource\. You can create a `$default` route that acts as a catch\-all for requests that don’t match any other routes\.
