# Distributing Your REST API to Clients<a name="rest-api-distribute"></a>

This section provides details about distributing your API Gateway APIs to your customers\. Distributing your API includes generating SDKs for your customers to download and integrate with their client applications, documenting your API so customers know how to call it from their client applications, making your API discoverable in a developer portal, and making your API available as part of product offerings \(including agreed\-upon request rates and quotas\)\.
