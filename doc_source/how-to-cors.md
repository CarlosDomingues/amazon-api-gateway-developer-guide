# Enable CORS for an API Gateway REST API Resource<a name="how-to-cors"></a>

[Cross\-origin resource sharing \(CORS\)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) is a browser security feature that restricts cross\-origin HTTP requests that are initiated from scripts running in the browser\. If your REST API's resources receive non\-simple cross\-origin HTTP requests, you need to enable CORS support\.

## Determining Whether to Enable CORS Support<a name="apigateway-cors-request-types"></a>

A *cross\-origin* HTTP request is one that is made to:
+ A different *domain* \(for example, from `example.com` to `amazondomains.com`\)
+ A different *subdomain* \(for example, from `example.com` to `petstore.example.com`\)
+ A different *port* \(for example, from `example.com` to `example.com:10777`\)
+ A different *protocol* \(for example, from `https://example.com` to `http://example.com`\)

Cross\-origin HTTP requests can be divided into two types: *simple* requests and *non\-simple* requests\.

An HTTP request is *simple* if all of the following conditions are true:
+ It is issued against an API resource that allows only `GET`, `HEAD`, and `POST` requests\.
+ If it is a `POST` method request, it must include an `Origin` header\.
+ The request payload content type is `text/plain`, `multipart/form-data`, or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`\.
+ The request does not contain custom headers\.
+ Any additional requirements that are listed in the [Mozilla CORS documentation for simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#Simple_requests)\.

For simple cross\-origin `POST` method requests, the response from your resource needs to include the header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, where the value of the header key is set to `'*'`\(any origin\) or is set to the origins allowed to access that resource\.

All other cross\-origin HTTP requests are *non\-simple* requests\. If your API's resources receive non\-simple requests, you'll need to enable CORS support\.

## What It Means to Enable CORS Support<a name="apigateway-responding-to-cors-preflight"></a>

When a browser receives a non\-simple HTTP request, the [CORS protocol](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-cors-protocol) requires the browser to send a preflight request to the server and wait for approval \(or a request for credentials\) from the server before sending the actual request\. The *preflight request* appears to your API as an HTTP request that:
+ Includes an `Origin` header\.
+ Uses the `OPTIONS` method\.
+ Includes the following headers:
  + `Access-Control-Request-Method`
  + `Access-Control-Request-Headers`

To support CORS, therefore, a REST API resource needs to implement an `OPTIONS` method that can respond to the `OPTIONS` preflight request with at least the following response headers mandated by the Fetch standard:
+ `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
+ `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
+ `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`

How you enable CORS support depends on your API's integration type\.

### Enabling CORS Support for Mock Integrations<a name="apigateway-enable-cors-mock"></a>

For a mock integration, you enable CORS by creating an `OPTIONS` method to return the required response headers \(with appropriate static values\) as the method response headers\. In addition, each of the actual CORS\-enabled methods must also return the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin:'request-originating server addresses'` header in at least its 200 response, where the value of the header key is set to `'*'` \(any origin\) or is set to the origins allowed to access the resource\.

### Enabling CORS Support for Lambda or HTTP Non\-Proxy Integrations and AWS Service Integrations<a name="apigateway-enable-cors-nonproxy"></a>

For a Lambda custom \(non\-proxy\) integration, HTTP custom \(non\-proxy\) integration, or AWS service integration, you can set up the required headers by using API Gateway method response and integration response settings\. API Gateway will create an `OPTIONS` method and attempt to add the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to your existing method integration responses\. This doesnâ€™t always work and sometimes you need to manually modify the integration response to properly enable CORS\. Usually this just means manually modifying the integration response to return the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header\.

### Enabling CORS Support for Lambda or HTTP Proxy Integrations<a name="apigateway-enable-cors-proxy"></a>

For a Lambda proxy integration or HTTP proxy integration, you can still set up the required `OPTIONS` response headers in API Gateway\. However, your backend is responsible for returning the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` headers, because a proxy integration doesn't return an integration response\.

The following is an example of a Node\.js Lambda function that is configured to return the required CORS headers:

```
'use strict';

exports.handler = function(event, context) {
    
    var responseCode = 200;
    
    var response = {
        statusCode: responseCode,
        headers: {
            "x-custom-header" : "my custom header value",
            "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "my-origin.com"
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(event)
    };
    
    context.succeed(response);
};
```

A more complete Node\.js example can be found at [https://github\.com/awslabs/serverless\-application\-model/blob/master/examples/2016\-10\-31/api\_swagger\_cors/index\.js](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/examples/2016-10-31/api_swagger_cors/index.js)\.

The following is an example of a Python code snippet that returns the required CORS headers:

```
response["headers"] = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json', 
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*' 
}
```

The following is an example that returns the required headers for CORS using Serverless Application Model \(SAM\), including `AllowHeaders`:

```
Globals:
  Api:
    # Allows an application running locally on port 8080 to call this API
    Cors:
      AllowMethods: "'OPTIONS,POST,GET'"
      AllowHeaders: "'Content-Type'"
      AllowOrigin: "'http://localhost:8080'"
```

The following is a Lambda proxy example that returns the same headers as the SAM example:

```
return {
    'statusCode': 200,
    'headers': {
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "http://localhost:8080",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "OPTIONS,POST,GET"
    },
    'body': json.dumps(response)
}
```

## Testing CORS<a name="apigateway-test-cors"></a>

You can test CORS by customizing the following `cURL` command for the actual method and origin header you are using:

```
curl -v -X OPTIONS -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" -H "Origin: http://example.com" https://{restapi_id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage_name}
```

## Enable CORS on a Resource Using the API Gateway Console<a name="how-to-cors-console"></a>

You can use the API Gateway console to enable CORS support for one or all methods on a REST API resource that you have created\.

**Important**  
Resources can contain child resources\. Enabling CORS support for a resource and its methods does not recursively enable it for child resources and their methods\.

**Enable CORS support on a REST API resource**

1. Sign in to the API Gateway console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/apigateway](https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway)\.

1. Choose the API from the **APIs** list\.

1. Choose a resource under **Resources**\. This will enable CORS for all the methods on the resource\.

   Alternatively, you could choose a method under the resource to enable CORS for just this method\.

1. Choose **Enable CORS** from the **Actions** drop\-down menu\.  
![\[Choose Enable CORS\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/images/amazon-api-gateway-enable-cors.png)

1.  In the **Enable CORS** form, do the following: 

   1.  In the **Access\-Control\-Allow\-Headers** input field, type a static string of a comma\-separated list of headers that the client must submit in the actual request of the resource\. Use the console\-provided header list of `'Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token'` or specify your own headers\. 

   1.  Use the console\-provided value of `'*'` as the **Access\-Control\-Allow\-Origin** header value to allow access requests from all origins, or specify origins to be permitted to access the resource\. 

   1. Choose **Enable CORS and replace existing CORS headers**\.  
![\[Choose which headers are allowed\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/images/amazon-api-gateway-enable-cors-resources.png)
**Important**  
 When applying the above instructions to the `ANY` method in a proxy integration, any applicable CORS headers will not be set\. Instead, your backend must return the applicable CORS headers, such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`\. 

1. In **Confirm method changes**, choose **Yes, overwrite existing values** to confirm the new CORS settings\.  
![\[Confirm overwrite of existing values\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/images/amazon-api-gateway-enable-cors-confirm-method-overwrite.png)

After CORS is enabled on the `GET` method, an `OPTIONS` method is added to the resource, if it is not already there\. The `200` response of the `OPTIONS` method is automatically configured to return the three `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers to fulfill preflight handshakes\. In addition, the actual \(`GET`\) method is also configured by default to return the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in its 200 response as well\. For other types of responses, you will need to manually configure them to return `Access-Control-Allow-Origin'` header with '\*' or specific origins, if you do not want to return the `Cross-origin access` error\.

After you enable CORS support on your resource, you must deploy or redeploy the API for the new settings to take effect\. For more information, see [Deploy a REST API from the API Gateway Console](how-to-deploy-api-with-console.md)\.
